# 🏯 Monastery360 – Hackathon Developer Playbook

A simplified version of the Monastery360 project designed for *college hackathon execution* while aligning with *SIH 2025 Problem 61*.

---

## 🎯 Hackathon Goal
Digitize and showcase the monasteries of Sikkim through a *working prototype* that highlights:
- Monastery profiles (history, rituals, architecture, images).  
- Interactive monastery map.  
- Festival & cultural calendar.  
- 360° virtual demo tour.  

---

## 📦 Phase 1 – Core Monastery Archive (Backend)

### 🗄️ Monastery Database
*Prompt:*  
"Create a NestJS backend with PostgreSQL that manages monastery data. Define tables for:  
- monasteries (id, name, location, history, rituals, architecture, founded_year, images, panoramic_urls).  
- festivals (id, monastery_id, name, date, description).  
- media (id, monastery_id, type [image, mural, manuscript, 360view], url).  

Include REST APIs for CRUD operations. Admin can add/edit, public can view. Implement Swagger docs for API testing."

---

## 📦 Phase 2 – Admin CMS (Frontend)

### 🖥️ Content Dashboard
*Prompt:*  
"Using Next.js with TypeScript, build an admin dashboard for monastery content entry. Features:  
- Login with JWT auth (admin role).  
- Form to add/edit monasteries with text and images.  
- Media gallery with drag-drop upload.  

Use TailwindCSS + ShadCN UI for design. Connect APIs from the NestJS backend."

---

## 📦 Phase 3 – Public Platform (Frontend)

### 🗺️ Interactive Map
*Prompt:*  
"Integrate Google Maps or Mapbox in Next.js to show monastery locations. Each marker opens a popup with:  
- Monastery name  
- Short description  
- Link to detailed profile page."

---

### 🌐 360° Virtual Tour (Demo)
*Prompt:*  
"Integrate Three.js (or pannellum.js) in Next.js to render a 360° panoramic monastery tour. Load panoramic image from the media table. Add simple hotspots that show murals or info when clicked."

---

### 📅 Festival & Ritual Calendar
*Prompt:*  
"Build a festival calendar in Next.js. Pull events from the festivals table. Display in month/week view using FullCalendar.js. Add filter by monastery."

---

## ✅ Hackathon Deliverables

By the end of the hackathon, the prototype should demonstrate:
1. *Backend + DB* → CRUD APIs for monasteries, festivals, media.  
2. *Admin CMS* → Add/edit monastery content and images.  
3. *Interactive Map* → Monasteries pinned with info popups.  
4. *Festival Calendar* → Monthly cultural events.  
5. *360° Tour (Demo)* → One monastery with a panoramic view + hotspots.
